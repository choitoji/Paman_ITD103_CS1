This project is called an Enrollment Monitoring System (EMS). This project is a potential system that can be used in monitoring and listing students that are currently enrolled and to be enrolled or added into a class. In the current state of the system, the admin can view the list of students that they have in the last 5 years of school and the gender population through data visualization. A calendar tool is also added for easier listing of events.  Complete with the Login Form, Dashboard and the Backend. The data stored can also be downloaded by the user in order to create backup data of the database.


Instructions in opening:

	-> Run the react-admin in terminal using "npm run start"
	-> Run the backend in terminal using "node index.js"
	-> Run the login-form in terminal using "npm run start"
	-> Now, you can freely navigate over the site!
